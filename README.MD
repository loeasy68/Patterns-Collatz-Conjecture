This article presents a set of mathematical patterns related to the Collatz Conjecture, with emphasis on the analysis of structural and behavioral patterns observed in specific subsequences. Before proceeding with the empirical explorations, the formal definitions that will serve as a conceptual basis for the studies presented are established below.

---

## Auxiliary Definitions

- **Parity of zero**: Define 0 as an **even** number.
- **Even number generating function**: $f(x) = 2x$, with $x \in \mathbb{N}$.
- **Odd number generating function**: $f(x) = 2x + 1$, with $x \in \mathbb{N}$.

## Proposed Definitions

The following definitions categorize certain subsets of numbers, based on specific properties observed in the context of the Collatz Conjecture (the names are given by convention):

- **Fermat number (F)**: Any even number $n$ such that $n / 2$ is also even. Formally, $n = 2^k \times m$, with $k \geq 2$ and $m$ odd.

- **Fermat collapse number (CF)**: A particular case of a Fermat number where $n$ is a power of two, i.e., $n = 2^k$.

- **Euler number (E)**: Any even number $n$ such that $n / 2$ evaluates to an odd number.

- **Gauss-Fermat number (GF)**: Every odd number $x$ such that $3x + 1$ is a Fermat number.

- **Gauss-Euler number (GE)**: Every odd number $x$ such that $3x + 1$ is an Euler number.

- **Gauss flow (FG)**: Function that applies the transformation $f(x) = 3(2x + 1) + 1 = 6x + 4$, corresponding to the application of the Collatz Conjecture mapping directly on odd numbers generated by the function $x = 2n + 1$.

## Gauss Table (GT)

The Gauss Table organizes the elements of the Gauss Flow in a systematic way, associating the entry (index) with its respective odd number, the value obtained by the transformation $3x + 1$, the factorization of this value (if it is even), and its classification according to the previous categories.


| **Column** | **Description** |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Index (n)** | Natural number used as input in the function $x = 2n + 1$, generating an odd number. |
| **Odd (x)** | Corresponding odd number, obtained by the odd generating function. |
| **$3x + 1$** | Result of the transformation applied to the odd number, associated with the dynamics of the Collatz Conjecture. |
| **Factorization** | Decomposition of the even number resulting from the operation $3x + 1$, highlighting powers of two. |
| **Type** | Classification according to the definitions: <br> ðŸ”¹ **F** for Fermat Numbers <br> ðŸ”¸ **E** for Euler Numbers |
